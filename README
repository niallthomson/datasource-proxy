This is a fork of the original datasource-proxy project at [url] by Tadaya Tsuyukubo.

The aim of the project is to provide a proxy which provides some hookpoints for collecting 
information about database related shenanigans for various purposes.

My interests lie in profiling the database queries using Spring AOP (see this project[TODO]), 
for which I had to extend the existing functionality so I could hook in properly using aspects.

My current goals are:

- Refactor some of the existing code the reduce code duplication
- Make the existing functionality (listeners, filters, interceptors etc.) more configurable


My possible future goals are:

- Explore the use of different methods for proxying (simple objects, AOP etc.)
- Performance testing

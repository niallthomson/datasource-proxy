This is a fork of the original datasource-proxy project at [url] by Tadaya Tsuyukubo.

The aim of the project is to provide a proxy which provides some hookpoints for collecting 
information about database related shenanigans for various purposes.

My interests lie in profiling the database queries using Spring AOP (see this project[TODO]), 
for which I had to extend the existing functionality so I could hook in properly using aspects.

I'm currently re-working how the library works, but basing all my work off the current implementation.
I expect to commit in a couple of weeks.
